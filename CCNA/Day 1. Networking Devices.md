### “A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.”

### A CLIENT is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.

### A SERVERS is  a device that provides functions or services for clients.


>**Note: The same device can be a client in some situations, and a server in other situations**

-------------------
## Switches(Level2):
- Have many network interfaces/ports for End Hosts to connect to.
- provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network)
- DO NOT provide connectivity between LANs/over the Internet.

## ROUTERS (Level 3):

- have fewer network interfaces than switches.
- are used to provide connectivity BETWEEN LANs.
- are used to send data over the Internet.


## Firewall (Can be Level 3,4, and 7):

- Firewalls are specialty hardware network security devices that control network traffic entering/exiting your network.
- monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules
- Can be places "inside" or "outside" the network.
- Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
- Are known as "Next-Generation Firewalls" when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.
- Host-based firewalls are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.


### Network firewalls...
are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.

### Host-based firewalls...
are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
